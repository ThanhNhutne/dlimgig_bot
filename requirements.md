# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating an automated bot that can download images from Instagram. The bot should be able to extract and save images from Instagram posts, stories, or profiles while respecting platform limitations and user privacy. The system should provide a simple interface for users to specify what content they want to download and where to save it.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to download images from Instagram posts by providing a post URL, so that I can save content locally for offline viewing or archival purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a valid Instagram post URL THEN the system SHALL extract and download all images from that post
2. WHEN a user provides an invalid or inaccessible URL THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
3. WHEN downloading images THEN the system SHALL preserve the original image quality and format
4. WHEN saving images THEN the system SHALL use descriptive filenames that include post metadata (username, date, etc.)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to specify a download directory, so that I can organize my downloaded images in a location of my choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user specifies a download directory THEN the system SHALL save all images to that location
2. IF no directory is specified THEN the system SHALL use a default downloads folder
3. WHEN the specified directory doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically
4. WHEN there are permission issues with the directory THEN the system SHALL notify the user with a clear error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to download images from Instagram stories, so that I can save temporary content before it expires.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a story URL or username THEN the system SHALL download available story images
2. WHEN stories are no longer available THEN the system SHALL inform the user that content has expired
3. WHEN downloading story content THEN the system SHALL respect privacy settings and only download publicly accessible content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to download all images from a specific Instagram profile, so that I can archive content from my favorite accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a username or profile URL THEN the system SHALL download all publicly accessible images from that profile
2. WHEN encountering private profiles THEN the system SHALL notify the user that content is not accessible
3. WHEN downloading profile images THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to avoid being blocked by Instagram
4. WHEN downloading large numbers of images THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback to the user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the bot to handle authentication if needed, so that I can access content that requires being logged in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL provide a secure way to input login credentials
2. WHEN login fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options
3. WHEN successfully authenticated THEN the system SHALL maintain the session for the duration of the download process
4. WHEN the session expires THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the bot to respect rate limits and avoid detection, so that my account doesn't get blocked or restricted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making requests to Instagram THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate delays between requests
2. WHEN detecting rate limiting responses THEN the system SHALL automatically back off and retry later
3. WHEN downloading content THEN the system SHALL use realistic user-agent strings and headers
4. WHEN making multiple requests THEN the system SHALL randomize request timing to appear more human-like

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see download progress and status updates, so that I know what the bot is doing and when it's finished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN downloads are in progress THEN the system SHALL display current status and progress information
2. WHEN downloads complete successfully THEN the system SHALL show a summary of downloaded files
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for troubleshooting
4. WHEN downloads are interrupted THEN the system SHALL provide options to resume or restart the process
